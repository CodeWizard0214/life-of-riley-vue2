              <strong>PURPOSES AND LAWFUL BASES FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We use your personal data to create and manage your account with
              us, to forward notifications that a provider of an Event has
              messaged you via our internal messaging system and to notify you
              of any changes to our Site or to our services that may affect you.
              Your personal data are necessary to enable us to provide you with
              the functionalities we offer.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may sometimes process personal data to comply with legal
              obligations imposed on us, for example in relation to the
              prevention of fraud and money laundering or in relation to tax
              regulations.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may also use your personal data if it is in our legitimate
              interests to do so. Such interests include our ongoing effort to
              provide, improve and safeguard the different functionalities we
              offer. We use your IP address to determine your approximate
              location (country and city within that country). We do this in our
              legitimate interest to filter the Events relevant to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              If none of the above lawful bases apply to the processing of your
              data, we rely on your consent to process such data. For example,
              if you enable your location on your device, this is considered to
              be your consent for us to process your location. If you do not
              want us to process your location, you can turn off this feature on
              your device. However, if you choose to turn off the location on
              your device you won’t be able to enjoy all of the functionalities
              of our App, because some of those will be based on your location.
              Besides personal data that we need to fulfill our obligations to
              you, you will also have the option to submit more information
              about yourself. This is done on a voluntary basis. By submitting
              such additional information, you express your consent to process
              such data.

            <p>
              In order to enable us to use your personal data for marketing
              purposes, such as sending you our newsletter by e-mail, we will
              ask for your express consent when you create an account. Whenever
              we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you can
              withdraw such consent at any time.

              becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal
              information without their consent, he or she should contact us so
              that we can remove such data immediately from our servers.

              <strong>HOW AND FOR HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong>

            <p>
              We put appropriate security measures in place to prevent personal
              data from being accidentally lost, or used or otherwise accessed
              in an unauthorised way. We limit access to your personal
              information to those who have a genuine business need to know it.
              Those processing your information will do so only in an authorised
              manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
            </p>
            <p>
              All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers,

            <p>
              You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. We ask

              Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is

              your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data
              transmitted to our Site; any transmission is at your own risk.
              Once we have received your information, we will use strict
              procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised
              access.

            <p>
              We only retain your personal data for as long as your account is
              active or for as long as we need it to fulfil the purposes for
              which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by
              law. We may retain certain information for longer to comply with
              applicable laws, to prevent fraud, or for obligations we have in
